This project really tested my ability to stay on track and figure out how to structure a website. I googled things that I did not know, but felt pretty good about what I did know. There are some things that I could not get perfect as shown in the example. However, I feel that I got close to what was shown. I learned some new things and tried different methods for stucturing the webpage. I also used percentages for the elements to keep them scaleable, this is something I wasn't familiar with before. This is was my first project that I actually wrote the whole entrie code base for and I am proud of how it turned out!
